# W00t

W00t is a really simple Ember and Rails app that does event-local microblogging.

It was created for [RailsCamp NZ 4](http://camp.ruby.org.nz/) because [Twetter](https://github.com/rnielsen/twetter) was broken.

W00t uses [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) to push new W00ts to the browser, so there's no refreshing or polling needed.

You can see it working [on heroku](http://woot.herokuapp.com/).

Thanks.
